    "### EXAMPLE 1 (negative polarity → annoyance)\n",

    "Aspect: staff\n",
    "Polarity: negative\n",
    "Correct Emotion: annoyance\n",
    "Reason: \"The waiter’s rude reaction clearly indicates irritation and frustration experienced by the customer during this interaction, creating a negative emotional impression.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXAMPLE 2 (negative polarity → disappointment)\n",
    "Review: \"The pasta looked amazing but tasted completely bland.\"\n",
    "Aspect: food\n",
    "Polarity: negative\n",
    "Correct Emotion: disappointment\n",
    "Reason: \"The dish visually impressed but failed in flavor, creating unmet expectations that lead the reviewer to express genuine disappointment about the meal.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXAMPLE 3 (positive polarity → admiration)\n",
    "Review: \"The chef crafted a beautifully balanced plate that stunned me.\"\n",
    "Aspect: food\n",
    "Polarity: positive\n",
    "Correct Emotion: admiration\n",
    "Reason: \"The reviewer expresses strong appreciation and respect for the food’s exceptional quality which clearly reflects genuine admiration for the culinary experience enjoyed.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXAMPLE 4 (positive polarity → satisfaction)\n",
    "Review: \"Our meals arrived quickly and tasted great.\"\n",
    "Aspect: service\n",

    "Reason: \"The reviewer describes timely and pleasant service that meets expectations, expressing a comfortable sense of satisfaction with the overall dining experience.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXAMPLE 5 (neutral polarity → mentioned_only)\n",
    "Review: \"The menu lists vegetarian options.\"\n",
    "Aspect: menu\n",
    "Polarity: neutral\n",
    "Correct Emotion: mentioned_only\n",
    "Reason: \"The reviewer simply states factual menu information without expressing any emotional stance, meaning the mention carries no emotional depth or subjective evaluation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXAMPLE 6 (neutral polarity → no_emotion)\n",
    "Review: \"There are tables near the back of the restaurant.\"\n",
    "Aspect: place\n",
    "Polarity: neutral\n",
    "Correct Emotion: no_emotion\n",
    "Reason: \"The description of seating location is presented factually without any emotional meaning, indicating no emotional content associated with the specific aspect described.\"\n",
